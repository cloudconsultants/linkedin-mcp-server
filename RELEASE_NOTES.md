## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Profiles System

### Profile Configurations
Configure performance vs stealth trade-offs using environment variables:

```bash
# Maximum performance (recommended for development)
export STEALTH_PROFILE=NO_STEALTH
export USE_NEW_STEALTH=true

# Balanced performance (recommended for production)
export STEALTH_PROFILE=MINIMAL_STEALTH
export USE_NEW_STEALTH=true

# Maximum stealth (high-risk environments)
export STEALTH_PROFILE=MAXIMUM_STEALTH
export USE_NEW_STEALTH=true
```

### Profile Specifications
| Profile | Target Time | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `NO_STEALTH` | 5-10s | Development, testing, high-trust environments |
| `MINIMAL_STEALTH` | 60-90s | Production, balanced performance/stealth |
| `MODERATE_STEALTH` | 120-180s | Moderate stealth requirements |
| `MAXIMUM_STEALTH` | 250-350s | High-risk environments, maximum stealth |

# Release Notes v1.5.0

## üöÄ Major Updates Since v1.4.0

This release represents a significant evolution of the LinkedIn MCP Server with major improvements in anti-detection, stability, and deployment efficiency.

---

## üé≠ Stealth Mode Implementation

### Complete Anti-Detection System
- **Migrated from Selenium to Playwright/Patchright** for superior browser automation
- **Implemented comprehensive stealth measures** to avoid LinkedIn detection:
  - Patchright integration for undetectable browser automation
  - Real Chrome browser usage (not Chromium) for authentic fingerprinting
  - Advanced user agent rotation with 50+ real browser profiles
  - Natural mouse movements and human-like interaction patterns
  - WebGL, Canvas, and Audio fingerprint spoofing
  - WebRTC leak prevention
  - Timezone and language matching
  - Proper viewport and screen resolution handling

### Dual Scraping Modes
- **Stealth Mode (Primary)**: Uses Patchright with Chrome for maximum evasion
- **Standard Mode (Fallback)**: Playwright with stealth plugin for compatibility
- Automatic fallback mechanism if stealth mode encounters issues

### Session Management Improvements
- Smart rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Session persistence across multiple requests
- Automatic cookie validation and renewal
- Graceful handling of security challenges
- **Session Warming Bypass**: Introduced optional bypass for environments where LinkedIn's redirect behavior causes issues

#### Session Warming Details
The system includes comprehensive session warming functionality (preserved in `behavioral.py`) that:
- Simulates human browsing patterns with natural mouse movements
- Gradually navigates through LinkedIn pages (home ‚Üí feed ‚Üí profile)
- Implements random delays and reading behavior patterns
- Handles security challenges and bot detection

However, a **bypass mode** has been introduced that:
- Skips problematic LinkedIn home page navigation that can cause redirect loops
- Adopts the legacy direct-profile-access approach (like the original Selenium implementation)
- Reduces authentication failures in containerized environments
- Maintains all stealth features while avoiding session warming bottlenecks

The full session warming code remains available and can be re-enabled by modifying the `warm_linkedin_session()` function in `linkedin_mcp_server/scraper/browser/behavioral.py` to restore the comprehensive warming protocol.

## üê≥ Docker Image Optimization (66% Size Reduction!)

### Dramatic Size Reduction
- **Before**: 4.15GB üò±
- **After**: 1.41GB üéâ
- **Savings**: 2.74GB (66% reduction)

```

### Optimization Techniques
- **Removed redundant browser installations**:
  - Eliminated duplicate Chromium installations

  - Removed development tools and test frameworks
  - Excluded CLI-only utilities
  - Stripped Playwright (Patchright provides the API)
- **System library minimization**:
  - Only essential browser dependencies
  - Cleaned apt cache and temporary files
