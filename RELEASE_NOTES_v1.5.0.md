# Release Notes v1.5.0

## üöÄ Major Updates Since v1.4.0

This release represents a significant evolution of the LinkedIn MCP Server with major improvements in anti-detection, stability, and deployment efficiency.

---

## üé≠ Stealth Mode Implementation

### Complete Anti-Detection System
- **Migrated from Selenium to Playwright/Patchright** for superior browser automation
- **Implemented comprehensive stealth measures** to avoid LinkedIn detection:
  - Patchright integration for undetectable browser automation
  - Real Chrome browser usage (not Chromium) for authentic fingerprinting
  - Advanced user agent rotation with 50+ real browser profiles
  - Natural mouse movements and human-like interaction patterns
  - WebGL, Canvas, and Audio fingerprint spoofing
  - WebRTC leak prevention
  - Timezone and language matching
  - Proper viewport and screen resolution handling

### Dual Scraping Modes
- **Stealth Mode (Primary)**: Uses Patchright with Chrome for maximum evasion
- **Standard Mode (Fallback)**: Playwright with stealth plugin for compatibility
- Automatic fallback mechanism if stealth mode encounters issues

### Session Management Improvements
- Smart rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Session persistence across multiple requests
- Automatic cookie validation and renewal
- Graceful handling of security challenges

---

## üîÑ Playwright Migration

### Architecture Overhaul
- **Complete removal of Selenium WebDriver** dependencies
- **Async-first architecture** using Playwright's async API
- Improved performance with ~30% faster page loads
- Better memory management and resource cleanup

### Enhanced Browser Control
- Native support for headless and headed modes
- Built-in request interception and modification
- Advanced network monitoring capabilities
- Improved error handling and recovery

### Stability Improvements
- More reliable element selection with auto-waiting
- Better handling of dynamic content loading
- Reduced flakiness in CI/CD environments
- Comprehensive retry mechanisms

## üê≥ Docker Image Optimization (66% Size Reduction!)

### Dramatic Size Reduction
- **Before**: 4.15GB üò±
- **After**: 1.41GB üéâ
- **Savings**: 2.74GB (66% reduction)

### Multi-Stage Build Architecture
Implemented sophisticated multi-stage Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.runtime`):

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder (compile dependencies)
# Stage 2: Runtime dependencies (minimal system libs)
# Stage 3: Final runtime (lean production image)
```

### Optimization Techniques
- **Removed redundant browser installations**:
  - Eliminated duplicate Chromium installations
  - Using only Patchright headless shell (saved ~594MB)
- **Runtime-only dependencies** (`pyproject.runtime.toml`):
  - Removed development tools and test frameworks
  - Excluded CLI-only utilities
  - Stripped Playwright (Patchright provides the API)
- **System library minimization**:
  - Only essential browser dependencies
  - Cleaned apt cache and temporary files
  - Optimized Python bytecode compilation

### Size Distribution (1.41GB Total)
```
Python Dependencies:     345MB (24%)
Browser (Headless):      326MB (23%)
System Libraries:        330MB (23%)
Base Python Image:       ~400MB (28%)
Application Code:        <1MB (<1%)
```

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

### Docker (Optimized Runtime Image)
```bash
# Build the optimized image (1.41GB instead of 4.15GB!)
docker build -f Dockerfile.runtime -t linkedin-mcp-server:1.5.0 .

# Run with stealth mode enabled
docker run -it --rm \
  -e LINKEDIN_COOKIE="li_at=YOUR_COOKIE" \
  linkedin-mcp-server:1.5.0
```

### Key Environment Variables
- `USE_STEALTH_ONLY=1` - Force stealth mode only
- `DOCKER_RUNTIME=1` - Optimize for Docker environment
- `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` - Enable detailed logging

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

1. **Selenium removed completely** - Any custom Selenium-based code needs migration
2. **New browser session management** - Sessions now use Playwright context
3. **Async API required** - All scraping operations are now async
4. **Docker image structure changed** - New multi-stage build may affect custom Dockerfiles

---

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From v1.4.0 to v1.5.0

If you're using custom configurations:

1. **Update Docker image references**:
   ```yaml
   # Old
   image: linkedin-mcp-server:1.4.0  # 4.15GB

   # New
   image: linkedin-mcp-server:1.5.0  # 1.41GB - 66% smaller!
   ```

2. **Update cookie configuration** (if using environment variables):
   ```bash
   # Cookie extraction is now more reliable
   docker run -it --rm linkedin-mcp-server:1.5.0 --get-cookie
   ```

3. **Browser configuration changes**:
   - Selenium ChromeDriver ‚Üí Playwright/Patchright
   - No more `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH` needed
   - Automatic browser installation handled
