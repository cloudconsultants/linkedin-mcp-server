# Current CSS Selector Issues Analysis

## Test Results Summary
**Profile**: `amir-nahvi-94814819`
**Current Output**: Malformed data with broken selectors
**Expected Output**: Clean structured data matching `testdata/testscrape.txt`

## Critical Selector Issues Identified

### 1. Experience Section - Broken Text Extraction
**Current Problem**:
```json
"company": "Co-Founder & Head of Hardware and Procurement\n    \n\n    \n      Advertima Vision AG\n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n            Dec 2021\n              -\n            \n        Present\n          \n          \n              3 yrs 10 mos\n          \n  \n    \n\n      \n        St Gallen, Switzerland\n      \n\n      \n        \n    \n    \n\n    We convert physical grocery stores into a revenue-generating Retail Media channel..."
```

**Expected Clean Output**:
```json
"company": "Advertima Vision AG · Full-time"
```

**Root Cause**: Current selectors are extracting entire container HTML instead of specific text elements.

### 2. Missing Education Data
**Current**: `"educations": []` (empty)
**Expected**: 4 education entries

**Indicates**: Education section selectors completely failing to find data.

### 3. Incomplete Experience Count
**Current**: 4 experiences extracted
**Expected**: 8 experiences (from testscrape.txt)

**Issue**: Missing 4 experience entries - selectors not finding all items on main page.

### 4. Malformed Basic Profile Data
**Current `job_title`**:
```json
"job_title": "Amir Nahvi\n 2nd\nCo-Founder | Head of Hardware & Procurement | Transforming in-store shoppers into digital Retail Media audiences in real-time\nGBS Gewerbliche Berufsschule St. Gallen  Advertima Vision AG\nSt Gallen, Switzerland  500+ connections"
```

**Expected**: `"job_title": "Co-Founder & Head of Hardware and Procurement"`

## Key Findings

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Authentication**: Fresh cookie works, no session kick-outs
2. **Basic Structure**: JSON structure template is correct
3. **Main Page Access**: Successfully navigating to and loading profile pages
4. **Name Extraction**: `"name": "Amir Nahvi"` correctly extracted

### ❌ What's Broken
1. **Text Extraction**: Selectors getting entire HTML containers instead of specific text
2. **Field Separation**: Unable to distinguish between position_title, company, dates, location
3. **Education Scraping**: Complete failure to find education section
4. **Data Parsing**: Raw HTML being returned instead of clean text

## Selenium vs Current Implementation Comparison

### Legacy Selenium (from linkedin_scraper library)
- **Approach**: Used proven CSS selectors that worked with LinkedIn's DOM
- **Output**: Clean, structured data matching testscrape.txt exactly
- **Data Completeness**: 8 experiences, 4 educations, all clean text
- **Main Page Only**: Extracted all data from profile page without detail navigation

### Current Playwright Implementation
- **Approach**: Multiple fallback selectors but targeting wrong elements
- **Output**: Raw HTML snippets and malformed data
- **Data Completeness**: Partial extraction with broken formatting
- **Main Page Access**: Correct approach but wrong selectors

## Required Selector Fixes

The current implementation needs complete CSS selector overhaul to match what the working Selenium library used. The main profile page contains all necessary data - we just need the correct selectors to extract it cleanly.

## Next Steps

1. **Update CSS selectors** to target specific text elements, not entire containers
2. **Fix education section selectors** to find the education data that exists on main page
3. **Improve experience parsing** to extract all 8 entries with clean text formatting
4. **Clean up basic info extraction** to separate name, headline, company properly

The good news: Main page has all the data. We just need better selectors to extract it cleanly like the legacy Selenium implementation did.
